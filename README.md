The Programming Event Hosting Platform is a web-based system designed to organize and manage online coding competitions efficiently. It allows admins to create events, add programming problems, and monitor participant activity. Users can register for events, view problems, and submit their code online. Each submission is evaluated using an AI-based model (CodeBERT) to assess code quality and correctness. The platform features a real-time leaderboard, helping participants track their performance and rankings. Built using Django for the backend and MongoDB for the database, the platform offers a custom admin panel for complete control over event and submission management. This project aims to streamline the process of hosting competitive programming events in educational and organizational settings.
